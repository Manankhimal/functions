/* ----------------Question 1---------------
 1. Write the SQL query to create the above table with all constraints.

Create database PW; 
use pw; 
create table employee (
emp_id int primary key not NULL,
emp_name Varchar(200) not NULL,
age Int, CHECK(age>18),
email varchar(200),
salary int
);

 ----------------Question 2---------------
-- 2. Explain the purpose of constraints and how they help maintain data integrity in a database. Provide examples of common types of constraints.
-- ANS. Constraints help enforce rules at the database level, preventing the entry of invalid data and ensuring data accuracy and reliability. Implementing various types of constraints such as primary key,
-- foreign key, unique, not null, check, and default constraints is crucial for upholding data quality. 

 ----------------Question 3---------------
-- 3.Why would you apply the NOT NULL constraint to a column? Can a primary key contain NULL values? Justify your answer.
-- The NOT NULL constraint is applied to a column to enforce that the column must always contain a value. It is done becouse of 
--  1> Data Integrity: It ensures that critical data fields are never left empty. This is crucial for maintaining the accuracy and consistency of your database.
-- 						For example, in a "Customers" table, you might apply NOT NULL to the "CustomerID," "FirstName," "LastName," and "Email" columns to ensure you always have essential customer information.
-- 2> Business Rules: It can enforce business rules that require certain fields to be populated. For instance, an "OrderDate" in an "Orders" table must always have a value to be meaningful.
-- 3> Preventing Errors: Allowing NULL values in certain columns can lead to unexpected behavior and errors in queries and applications that rely on that data. calculations, and reports.
-- 4> Required Information: When information is required for the record to be useful, not null is very important.
    
--  Primary Key : NO a primary key cannot have a Null value 
--  1> Uniqueness: A primary key's fundamental purpose is to uniquely identify each row in a table. If a primary key column could contain NULL values, it would violate this uniqueness requirement. Multiple rows could have NULL as their primary key value, making it impossible to distinguish them.
-- 2> Identification: Primary keys are used to establish relationships between tables (foreign keys). If a primary key could be NULL, it would break these relationships, as foreign keys rely on referencing valid primary key values.
-- 3> Definition: By definition, a primary key is a column or set of columns that uniquely identifies a row in a table and it cannot contain nulls. Primary key constraints are a combination of UNIQUE and NOT NULL constraints.

 ----------------Question 4---------------
4.  Explain the steps and SQL commands used to add or remove constraints on an existing table. Provide an example for both adding and removing a constraint.
ANS: Constraints in SQL are rules enforced on data in tables to maintain integrity. You can add or remove constraints on an existing table using ALTER TABLE commands.
1. Adding a Constraint
Steps to Add a Constraint
->	Use the ALTER TABLE command.
->	Specify the table name.
->	Use the ADD CONSTRAINT clause.
->  Define the type of constraint (e.g., PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK, DEFAULT).

ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_email UNIQUE (email);


2. Removing a Constraint
->	Steps to Remove a Constraint
->	Use the ALTER TABLE command.
->	Specify the table name.
->	Use the DROP CONSTRAINT clause.
->	Provide the name of the constraint (found in INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_CONSTRAINTS or defined during creation).
 
ALTER TABLE Employees
DROP CONSTRAINT unique_email;


 ----------------Question 5---------------
5. Explain the consequences of attempting to insert, update, or delete data in a way that violates constraints. Provide an example of an error message that might occur when violating a constraint.
Ans: SQL constraints ensure data integrity and consistency in a database. When an operation violates a constraint (such as PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK, or NOT NULL), the database rejects the operation and returns an error.

1. Violating a PRIMARY KEY Constraint
A PRIMARY KEY constraint ensures that a column has unique, non-null values. Attempting to insert a duplicate value will result in an error.
	Example:
		INSERT INTO Employees (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Alice');
		INSERT INTO Employees (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Bob'); -- Violates PRIMARY KEY constraint

	Error Message:
		ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "employees_pkey"
        
2. Violating a FOREIGN KEY Constraint
A FOREIGN KEY constraint ensures referential integrity between two tables. If an inserted value does not exist in the referenced table, it causes an error.
	Example:
		INSERT INTO Orders (order_id, customer_id) VALUES (101, 999); -- 999 does not exist in Customers table

	Error Message:
		ERROR: insert or update on table "Orders" violates foreign key constraint "orders_customer_id_fkey"


3. Violating a UNIQUE Constraint
A UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are distinct. Attempting to insert a duplicate value leads to an error.
	Example:
		INSERT INTO Users (

-- ----------------Question 1--------------
/*### Violation of 1NF in the Sakila Database  

  First Normal Form (1NF) ensures that:  
1. Each column has atomic values (no multiple values in one field).  
2. There are **no repeating groups** in a table.  

####   Table That Violates 1NF: `film_text` 
In the Sakila database, the `film_text` table violates 1NF because:  
- The `description` column stores multiple details (genre, actors, and summary in one field).  
- It lacks atomicity, making queries inefficient.  

####   Normalization to Achieve 1NF  
To fix this:  
1. Split `description` into separate attributes (`genre`, `summary`).  
2. Create a new table `film_actor` to store actors separately.  

  New Tables:  
- `film_text (film_id, genre, summary)`  
- `film_actor (film_id, actor_name)`  

This removes multi-valued fields, ensures atomicity, and makes data retrieval more efficient. -- 

-- -----------------------------Question 2-----------------------------------

### **Checking 2NF in the Sakila Database**  

A table is in **Second Normal Form (2NF)** if:  
1. It is in **1NF** (atomic values, no repeating groups).  
2. **No partial dependencies** (non-key attributes must depend on the entire primary key).  

#### **Example: `rental` Table**  
| rental_id | customer_id | inventory_id | rental_date | return_date | staff_id |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| 1         | 101        | 2001        | 2024-01-01  | 2024-01-07  | 3        |

- **Primary Key:** `rental_id`  
- **Partial Dependency:** `staff_id` depends on `inventory_id`, not `rental_id` â **Violates 2NF**  

#### **Normalization to 2NF**  
- Move `staff_id` to a new **`rental_staff`** table.  

**`rental` (2NF Compliant)**  
| rental_id | customer_id | inventory_id | rental_date | return_date |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1         | 101        | 2001        | 2024-01-01  | 2024-01-07  |

**New `rental_staff` Table**  
| rental_id | staff_id |
|-----------|---------|
| 1         | 3       |

Now, all attributes fully depend on the primary key, making it **2NF compliant**. 



-- -----------------------------Question 3-----------------------------------
### **Identifying 3NF Violation in the Sakila Database**  

#### **Understanding Third Normal Form (3NF)**  
A table is in **Third Normal Form (3NF)** if:  
1. It is already in **Second Normal Form (2NF)**.  
2. **No transitive dependencies** exist â meaning **non-key attributes should depend only on the primary key, not on other non-key attributes**.  

---

### **Table That Violates 3NF: `customer`**  
| customer_id | store_id | first_name | last_name | address_id | address | city | postal_code | country |
|------------|---------|------------|-----------|------------|---------|------|-------------|---------|
| 101        | 1       | John       | Doe       | 5001       | XYZ St  | Miami  | 33101        | USA     |
| 102        | 2       | Jane       | Smith     | 5002       | ABC Rd  | Dallas | 75001        | USA     |

---

#### **Transitive Dependencies in `customer` Table**  
- **Primary Key:** `customer_id`  
- **Issue:** `city` and `country` depend on `address_id`, not directly on `customer_id`.  
- This creates a **transitive dependency** (`customer_id â address_id â city, country`).  

---

### **Normalization to 3NF**  
To remove transitive dependencies:  
1. **Separate address-related details** into a new `address` table.  
2. **Keep only `address_id`** in `customer`, linking it to `address`.  

#### **New `customer` Table (3NF Compliant)**  
| customer_id | store_id | first_name | last_name | address_id |
|------------|---------|------------|-----------|------------|
| 101        | 1       | John       | Doe       | 5001       |
| 102        | 2       | Jane       | Smith     | 5002       |

#### **New `address` Table**  
| address_id | address | city   | postal_code | country |
|------------|---------|--------|-------------|---------|
| 5001       | XYZ St  | Miami  | 33101       | USA     |
| 5002       | ABC Rd  | Dallas | 75001       | USA     |

Now, all attributes depend **only on the primary key** of their respective tables, ensuring **3NF compliance**. 

-- -----------------------------Question 4-----------------------------------
### **Normalization of `customer` Table (Up to 2NF)**  

#### **Unnormalized Form (UNF)**  
| customer_id | name      | phone_numbers      | address  | city   | postal_code | country |
|------------|----------|------------------|---------|--------|-------------|---------|
| 101        | John Doe | 123456, 789012   | XYZ St  | Miami  | 33101       | USA     |

**Issue:** Multi-valued `phone_numbers`.  

#### **1NF (Atomic Values, No Repeating Groups)**  
| customer_id | name      | phone_number | address  | city   | postal_code | country |
|------------|----------|-------------|---------|--------|-------------|---------|
| 101        | John Doe | 123456      | XYZ St  | Miami  | 33101       | USA     |
| 101        | John Doe | 789012      | XYZ St  | Miami  | 33101       | USA     |

**Fix:** Separated multi-valued `phone_numbers`.  

#### **2NF (Remove Partial Dependency)**  
**Issue:** `address`, `city`, `postal_code`, and `country` depend only on `customer_id`.  

**Solution:** Split into separate tables.  

1. **`customer` Table**  
| customer_id | name      | address_id |
|------------|----------|------------|
| 101        | John Doe | 5001       |

2. **`customer_phone` Table**  
| customer_id | phone_number |
|------------|-------------|
| 101        | 123456      |
| 101        | 789012      |

3. **`address` Table**  
| address_id | address  | city   | postal_code | country |
|------------|---------|--------|-------------|---------|
| 5001       | XYZ St  | Miami  | 33101       | USA     |

Now, the table is in **2NF** with no partial dependencies. */
